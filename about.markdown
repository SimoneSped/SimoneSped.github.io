Greetings!

My name is Simone Spedicato, I come from a rural town in southern Italy, and at present I am pursuing a Master's degree in Astronomy and Astrophysics at the University of Vienna in Austria. Additionally, I am also a Bachelor's student of Physics at the same University. My areas of interest encompass machine learning, nano-technologies, star-forming regions, and planetary sciences.

I have an active role as a junior science communicator, specializing in outreach initiatives. Specifically, I proudly represent Austria as the Austrian representative at the Central European Hub of Europlanet.
