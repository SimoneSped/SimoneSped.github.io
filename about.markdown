Hey there! 

{% include gallery.html  gallery=1 %}

Welcome to my personal website! 
I'm Simone Spedicato, originally from a quaint town in the Apulia region of southern Italy. 
Currently, I am pursuing a Master's degree in Astronomy and Astrophysics at the University of Vienna in Austria, while simultaneously completing my Bachelor's degree in Physics at the same institution.

My academic journey has opened doors to a fascinating realm where the vastness of the cosmos intersects with the intricacies of scientific exploration. 
My studies have ignited a profound interest in various subjects, ranging from the dynamic field of machine learning to the captivating realms of nano-technologies, star formation, and planetary sciences. 
I find great fulfillment in unraveling the mysteries of the universe and delving into the depths of scientific discovery.

Beyond the world of academia, I embrace a myriad of diverse interests. 
I am an avid cyclist, relishing the freedom and serenity that comes with exploring the world on two wheels (see my happy face in the selfie taken in the vineyards near Vienna).
 Traveling to new destinations is a passion that continually broadens my horizons, providing me with unique experiences and cultural encounters that shape my worldview.
 When I'm not on the move, you can often find me immersed in the depths of a captivating book or indulging in the therapeutic embrace of swimming.

One of my greatest joys lies in science communication.
 I am deeply committed to sharing the wonders of the universe with others and actively engage in outreach programs.
 It is through these endeavors that I aim to inspire curiosity and foster a love for science in individuals of all ages.
 In fact, I proudly represent Austria as the Austrian representative at the Central European Hub of [Europlanet](https://www.europlanet-society.org), where I have the privilege of collaborating with fellow enthusiasts to promote scientific exploration and education.

Thank you for visiting my website. Join me on this journey as I navigate the vast cosmos, unravel the mysteries of science, and explore the beauty of our world and beyond.
