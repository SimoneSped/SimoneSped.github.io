Hey there!

My name is Simone Spedicato, and I come from a small town in the Apulia region of southern Italy. Currently, I'm pursuing a Master's degree in Astronomy and Astrophysics at the University of Vienna in Austria. Additionally, I'm also a Bachelor's student in Physics at the same university. My interests span a wide range of subjects, including machine learning, nano-technologies, star formation, and planetary sciences.

I have a strong passion for science communication and actively participate in outreach programs. It's a role that brings me a lot of joy. As a matter of fact, I proudly represent Austria as the Austrian representative at the Central European Hub of [Europlanet](https://www.europlanet-society.org).
